      Scripts.com Bee Movie By Jerry Seinfeld NARRATOR: (Black screen with text;
      The sound of buzzing bees can be heard) According to all known laws of
      aviation, : there is no way a bee should be able to fly. : Its wings are
      too small to get its fat little body off the ground. : The bee, of course,
      flies anyway : because bees don&apos;t care what humans think is
      impossible. BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black.
      Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. : Ooh, black and yellow!
      Let&apos;s shake it up a little. JANET BENSON: Barry! Breakfast is ready!
      BARRY: Coming! : Hang on a second. (Barry uses his antenna like a phone) :
      Hello? ADAM FLAYMAN: (Through phone) - Barry? BARRY: - Adam? ADAM: - Can
      you believe this is happening? BARRY: - I can&apos;t. I&apos;ll pick you
      up. (Barry flies down the stairs) : MARTIN BENSON: Looking sharp. JANET:
      Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. BARRY: Sorry.
      I&apos;m excited. MARTIN: Here&apos;s the graduate. We&apos;re very proud
      of you, son. : A perfect report card, all B&apos;s. JANET: Very proud.
      (Rubs Barry&apos;s hair) BARRY= Ma! I got a thing going here. JANET: - You
      got lint on your fuzz. BARRY: - Ow! That&apos;s me! JANET: - Wave to us!
      We&apos;ll be in row 118,000. - Bye! (Barry flies out the door) JANET:
      Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! (Barry drives through the
      hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a newspaper) BARRY== - Hey,
      Adam. ADAM: - Hey, Barry. (Adam gets in Barry&apos;s car) : - Is that fuzz
      gel? BARRY: - A little. Special day, graduation. ADAM: Never thought
      I&apos;d make it. (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)
      BARRY: Three days grade school, three days high school... ADAM: Those were
      awkward. BARRY: Three days college. I&apos;m glad I took a day and
      hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM== You did come back different. (Barry and
      Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging) ARTIE: - Hi, Barry! BARRY: - Artie,
      growing a mustache? Looks good. ADAM: - Hear about Frankie? BARRY: - Yeah.
      ADAM== - You going to the funeral? BARRY: - No, I&apos;m not going to his
      funeral. : Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. : Don&apos;t waste it
      on a squirrel. Such a hothead. ADAM: I guess he could have just gotten out
      of the way. (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and
      lands on the highway) : I love this incorporating an amusement park into
      our regular day. BARRY: I guess that&apos;s why they say we don&apos;t
      need vacations. (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over
      the graduating students) Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the
      circumstances. (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats) : - Well,
      Adam, today we are men. ADAM: - We are! BARRY= - Bee-men. =ADAM= - Amen!
      BARRY AND ADAM: Hallelujah! (Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm)
      ANNOUNCER: Students, faculty, distinguished bees, : please welcome Dean
      Buzzwell. DEAN BUZZWELL: Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... :
      ...9: : That concludes our ceremonies. : And begins your career at Honex
      Industries! ADAM: Will we pick our job today? (Adam and Barry get into a
      tour bus) BARRY= I heard it&apos;s just orientation. (Tour buses rise out
      of the ground and the students are automatically loaded into the buses)
      TOUR GUIDE: Heads up! Here we go. ANNOUNCER: Keep your hands and antennas
      inside the tram at all times. BARRY: - Wonder what it&apos;ll be like?
      ADAM: - A little scary. TOUR GUIDE== Welcome to Honex, a division of
      Honesco : and a part of the Hexagon Group. Barry: This is it! BARRY AND
      ADAM: Wow. BARRY: Wow. (The bus drives down a road an on either side are
      the Bee&apos;s massive complicated Honey-making machines) TOUR GUIDE: We
      know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life : to get to the point
      where you can work for your whole life. : Honey begins when our valiant
      Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. : Our top-secret formula : is
      automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured : into
      this soothing sweet syrup : with its distinctive golden glow you know
      as... EVERYONE ON BUS: Honey! (The guide has been collecting honey into a
      bottle and she throws it into the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a
      girl in the back) ADAM: - That girl was hot. BARRY: - She&apos;s my
      cousin! ADAM== - She is? BARRY: - Yes, we&apos;re all cousins. ADAM: -
      Right. You&apos;re right. TOUR GUIDE: - At Honex, we constantly strive :
      to improve every aspect of bee existence. : These bees are stress-testing
      a new helmet technology. (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is
      being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He
      lifts a thumbs up but you can hear him groan) : ADAM== - What do you think
      he makes? BARRY: - Not enough. TOUR GUIDE: Here we have our latest
      advancement, the Krelman. (They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing
      on pegs, who are each wearing a finger-shaped hat) Barry: - Wow, What does
      that do? TOUR GUIDE: - Catches that little strand of honey : that hangs
      after you pour it. Saves us millions. ADAM: (Intrigued) Can anyone work on
      the Krelman? TOUR GUIDE: Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees
      know that every small job, if it&apos;s done well, means a lot. : But
      choose carefully : because you&apos;ll stay in the job you pick for the
      rest of your life. (Everyone claps except for Barry) BARRY: The same job
      the rest of your life? I didn&apos;t know that. ADAM: What&apos;s the
      difference? TOUR GUIDE: You&apos;ll be happy to know that bees, as a
      species, haven&apos;t had one day off : in 27 million years. BARRY:
      (Upset) So you&apos;ll just work us to death? : We&apos;ll sure try.
      (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back
      home together) ADAM: Wow! That blew my mind! BARRY: &quot;What&apos;s the
      difference?&quot; How can you say that? : One job forever? That&apos;s an
      insane choice to have to make. ADAM: I&apos;m relieved. Now we only have
      to make one decision in life. BARRY: But, Adam, how could they never have
      told us that? ADAM: Why would you question anything? We&apos;re bees. :
      We&apos;re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. BARRY: You
      ever think maybe things work a little too well here? ADAM: Like what? Give
      me one example. (Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the
      audience that hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them
      in perfect unison) BARRY: I don&apos;t know. But you know what I&apos;m
      talking about. ANNOUNCER: Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on
      approach. BARRY: Wait a second. Check it out. (The Pollen jocks fly in,
      circle around and landing in line) : - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! ADAM:
      - Wow. : I&apos;ve never seen them this close. BARRY: They know what
      it&apos;s like outside the hive. ADAM: Yeah, but some don&apos;t come
      back. GIRL BEES: - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! (The Pollen Jocks hook up
      their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar to trucks, which drive
      away) LOU LO DUVA: You guys did great! : You&apos;re monsters! You&apos;re
      sky freaks! I love it! (Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy) I love it! ADAM:
      - I wonder where they were. BARRY: - I don&apos;t know. : Their day&apos;s
      not planned. : Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows
      what. : You can&apos;t just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be
      bred for that. ADAM== Right. (Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen
      that floated off of the Pollen Jocks) BARRY: Look at that. That&apos;s
      more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. ADAM: It&apos;s just a
      status symbol. Bees make too much of it. BARRY: Perhaps. Unless
      you&apos;re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. (Barry waves at
      2 girls standing a little away from them) ADAM== Those ladies? Aren&apos;t
      they our cousins too? BARRY: Distant. Distant. POLLEN JOCK #1: Look at
      these two. POLLEN JOCK #2: - Couple of Hive Harrys. POLLEN JOCK #1: -
      Let&apos;s have fun with them. GIRL BEE #1: It must be dangerous being a
      Pollen Jock. BARRY: Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! : He
      had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps
      Adam with his hand to represent his scenario) GIRL BEE #2: - Oh, my!
      BARRY: - I never thought I&apos;d knock him out. GIRL BEE #1: (Looking at
      Adam) What were you doing during this? ADAM: Obviously I was trying to
      alert the authorities. BARRY: I can autograph that. (The pollen jocks walk
      up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen
      jocks.) POLLEN JOCK #1: A little gusty out there today, wasn&apos;t it,
      comrades? BARRY: Yeah. Gusty. POLLEN JOCK #1: We&apos;re hitting a
      sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY: - Six miles, huh?
      ADAM: - Barry! POLLEN JOCK #2: A puddle jump for us, but maybe you&apos;re
      not up for it. BARRY: - Maybe I am. ADAM: - You are not! POLLEN JOCK #1:
      We&apos;re going 0900 at J-Gate. : What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you
      bee enough? BARRY: I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. (The
      scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at
      night) MARTIN: Hey, Honex! BARRY: Dad, you surprised me. MARTIN: You
      decide what you&apos;re interested in? BARRY: - Well, there&apos;s a lot
      of choices. - But you only get one. : Do you ever get bored doing the same
      job every day? MARTIN: Son, let me tell you about stirring. : You grab
      that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. : You get
      yourself into a rhythm. It&apos;s a beautiful thing. BARRY: You know, Dad,
      the more I think about it, : maybe the honey field just isn&apos;t right
      for me. MARTIN: You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? :
      That&apos;s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. : Janet, your son&apos;s
      not sure he wants to go into honey! JANET: - Barry, you are so funny
      sometimes. BARRY: - I&apos;m not trying to be funny. MARTIN: You&apos;re
      not funny! You&apos;re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! JANET: -
      You&apos;re gonna be a stirrer? BARRY: - No one&apos;s listening to me!
      MARTIN: Wait till you see the sticks I have. BARRY: I could say anything
      right now. I&apos;m gonna get an ant tattoo! (Barry&apos;s parents
      don&apos;t listen to him and continue to ramble on) MARTIN: Let&apos;s
      open some honey and celebrate! BARRY: Maybe I&apos;ll pierce my thorax.
      Shave my antennae. : Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and
      call everybody &quot;dawg&quot;! JANET: I&apos;m so proud. (The scene cuts
      to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job) ADAM: - We&apos;re
      starting work today! BARRY: - Today&apos;s the day. ADAM: Come on! All the
      good jobs will be gone. BARRY: Yeah, right. JOB LISTER: Pollen counting,
      stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... BEE IN FRONT OF
      LINE: - Is it still available? JOB LISTER: - Hang on. Two left! : One of
      them&apos;s yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. ADAM: - What&apos;d
      you get? BEE IN FRONT OF LINE: - Picking crud out. Stellar! (He walks
      away) ADAM: Wow! JOB LISTER: Couple of newbies? ADAM: Yes, sir! Our first
      day! We are ready! JOB LISTER: Make your choice. (Adam and Barry look up
      at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly changing panels that
      contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very confusing) ADAM: -
      You want to go first? BARRY: - No, you go. ADAM: Oh, my. What&apos;s
      available? JOB LISTER: Restroom attendant&apos;s open, not for the reason
      you think. ADAM: - Any chance of getting the Krelman? JOB LISTER: - Sure,
      you&apos;re on. (Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam&apos;s head)
      (Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out) : I&apos;m sorry, the Krelman
      just closed out. (Takes Adam&apos;s hat off) Wax monkey&apos;s always
      open. ADAM: The Krelman opened up again. : What happened? JOB LISTER: A
      bee died. Makes an opening. See? He&apos;s dead. Another dead one. :
      Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. : Dead from the neck up. Dead from the
      neck down. That&apos;s life! ADAM: Oh, this is so hard! (Barry remembers
      what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off) Heating, cooling, stunt
      bee, pourer, stirrer, : humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator,
      stripe supervisor, : mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should...
      Barry? (Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away) : Barry! POLLEN
      JOCK: All right, we&apos;ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
      ADAM: (Through phone) What happened to you? Where are you? BARRY: -
      I&apos;m going out. ADAM: - Out? Out where? BARRY: - Out there. ADAM: -
      Oh, no! BARRY: I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
      ADAM: You&apos;re gonna die! You&apos;re crazy! (Barry hangs up) Hello?
      POLLEN JOCK #2: Another call coming in. : If anyone&apos;s feeling brave,
      there&apos;s a Korean deli on 83rd : that gets their roses today. BARRY:
      Hey, guys. POLLEN JOCK #1 == - Look at that. POLLEN JOCK #2: - Isn&apos;t
      that the kid we saw yesterday? LOU LO DUVA: Hold it, son, flight
      deck&apos;s restricted. POLLEN JOCK #1: It&apos;s OK, Lou. We&apos;re
      gonna take him up. (Puts hand on Barry&apos;s shoulder) LOU LO DUVA: (To
      Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you? BEE WITH CLIPBOARD: (To Barry) Sign
      here, here. Just initial that. : - Thank you. LOU LO DUVA: - OK. : You got
      a rain advisory today, : and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. :
      So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, : hockey sticks, dogs, birds,
      bears and bats. : Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being
      poured on us. : Murphy&apos;s in a home because of it, babbling like a
      cicada! BARRY: - That&apos;s awful. LOU LO DUVA: (Still talking through
      megaphone) - And a reminder for you rookies, : bee law number one,
      absolutely no talking to humans! : All right, launch positions! POLLEN
      JOCKS: (The Pollen Jocks run into formation) : Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
      Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! LOU LU DUVA: Black and
      yellow! POLLEN JOCKS: Hello! POLLEN JOCK #1: (To Barry)You ready for this,
      hot shot? BARRY: Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. POLLEN JOCK&apos;s: Wind, check.
      : - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. : - Wings, check. - Stinger,
      check. BARRY: Scared out of my shorts, check. LOU LO DUVA: OK, ladies, :
      let&apos;s move it out! : Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
      : All of you, drain those flowers! (The pollen jocks fly out of the hive)
      BARRY: Wow! I&apos;m out! : I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m out! : So blue.
      : I feel so fast and free! : Box kite! (Barry flies through the kite) :
      Wow! : Flowers! (A pollen jock puts on some high tech goggles that shows
      flowers similar to heat sink goggles.) POLLEN JOCK: This is Blue Leader.
      We have roses visual. : Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. : Roses!
      POLLEN JOCK #1: 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. : Stand to the
      side, kid. It&apos;s got a bit of a kick. (The pollen jock fires a
      high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that suck up the nectar from
      the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun) BARRY: That is one
      nectar collector! POLLEN JOCK #1== - Ever see pollination up close? BARRY:
      - No, sir. POLLEN JOCK #1: (Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field,
      the pollen jock sprinkles pollen as he goes) : I pick up some pollen here,
      sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, : a pinch on that one. See
      that? It&apos;s a little bit of magic. BARRY: That&apos;s amazing. Why do
      we do that? POLLEN JOCK #1: That&apos;s pollen power. More pollen, more
      flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY: Cool. POLLEN JOCK #1:
      I&apos;m picking up a lot of bright yellow. could be daisies. Don&apos;t
      we need those? POLLEN JOCK #2: Copy that visual. : Wait. One of these
      flowers seems to be on the move. POLLEN JOCK #1: Say again? You&apos;re
      reporting a moving flower? POLLEN JOCK #2: Affirmative. (The Pollen jocks
      land near the &quot;flowers&quot; which, to the audience are obviously
      just tennis balls) KEN: (In the distance) That was on the line! POLLEN
      JOCK #1: This is the coolest. What is it? POLLEN JOCK #2: I don&apos;t
      know, but I&apos;m loving this color. : It smells good. Not like a flower,
      but I like it. POLLEN JOCK #1: Yeah, fuzzy. (Sticks his hand on the ball
      but it gets stuck) POLLEN JOCK #3== Chemical-y. (The pollen jock finally
      gets his hand free from the tennis ball) POLLEN JOCK #1: Careful, guys.
      It&apos;s a little grabby. (The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry
      lying his entire body on top of one of the tennis balls) POLLEN JOCK #2:
      My sweet lord of bees! POLLEN JOCK #3: Candy-brain, get off there! POLLEN
      JOCK #1: (Pointing upwards) Problem! (A human hand reaches down and grabs
      the tennis ball that Barry is stuck to) BARRY: - Guys! POLLEN JOCK #2: -
      This could be bad. POLLEN JOCK #3: Affirmative. (Vanessa Bloome starts
      bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick to it) BARRY== Very
      close. : Gonna hurt. : Mama&apos;s little boy. (Barry is being hit back
      and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is still stuck to the ball)
      POLLEN JOCK #1: You are way out of position, rookie! KEN: Coming in at you
      like a MISSILE! (Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the
      ball) BARRY: (In slow motion) Help me! POLLEN JOCK #2: I don&apos;t think
      these are flowers. POLLEN JOCK #3: - Should we tell him? POLLEN JOCK #1: -
      I think he knows. BARRY: What is this?! KEN: Match point! : You can start
      packing up, honey, because you&apos;re about to EAT IT! (A pollen jock
      coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way with Barry
      stuck to it and it goes flying into the city) BARRY: Yowser! (Barry
      bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies into
      the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there) BARRY: Ew,
      gross. (The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows
      Barry into the car) GIRL IN CAR: There&apos;s a bee in the car! : - Do
      something! DAD DRIVING CAR: - I&apos;m driving! BABY GIRL: (Waving at
      Barry) - Hi, bee. (Barry smiles and waves at the baby girl) GUY IN BACK OF
      CAR: - He&apos;s back here! : He&apos;s going to sting me! GIRL IN CAR:
      Nobody move. If you don&apos;t move, he won&apos;t sting you. Freeze!
      (Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car) : GRANDMA IN
      CAR== He blinked! (The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays
      everywhere in the car, climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray
      Barry) GIRL IN CAR: Spray him, Granny! DAD DRIVING THE CAR: What are you
      doing?! (Barry escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying
      high above the ground, safe.) BARRY: Wow... the tension level out here is
      unbelievable. (Barry sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see
      rain clouds moving into this direction) : I gotta get home. : Can&apos;t
      fly in rain. : Can&apos;t fly in rain. (A rain drop hits Barry and one of
      his wings is damaged) : Can&apos;t fly in rain. (A second rain drop hits
      Barry again and he spirals downwards) Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! (WW2
      plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a
      plant inside an apartment near the window) VANESSA BLOOME: Ken, could you
      close the window please? KEN== Hey, check out my new resume. I made it
      into a fold-out brochure. : You see? (Folds brochure resume out) Folds
      out. (Ken closes the window, trapping Barry inside) BARRY: Oh, no. More
      humans. I don&apos;t need this. (Barry tries to fly away but smashes into
      the window and falls again) : What was that? (Barry keeps trying to fly
      out the window but he keeps being knocked back because the window is
      closed) Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time!
      This... : Drapes! (Barry taps the glass. He doesn&apos;t understand what
      it is) That is diabolical. KEN: It&apos;s fantastic. It&apos;s got all my
      special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. ANDY: What&apos;s number
      one? Star Wars? KEN: Nah, I don&apos;t go for that... (Ken makes finger
      guns and makes &quot;pew pew pew&quot; sounds and then stops) : ...kind of
      stuff. BARRY: No wonder we shouldn&apos;t talk to them. They&apos;re out
      of their minds. KEN: When I leave a job interview, they&apos;re
      flabbergasted, can&apos;t believe what I say. BARRY: (Looking at the light
      on the ceiling) There&apos;s the sun. Maybe that&apos;s a way out. (Starts
      flying towards the lightbulb) : I don&apos;t remember the sun having a big
      75 on it. (Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table
      that the humans are sitting at) KEN: I predicted global warming. : I could
      feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. (Andy dips a
      chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and is about to
      put it in his mouth) : Wait! Stop! Bee! (Andy drops the chip with Barry in
      fear and backs away. All the humans freak out) : Stand back. These are
      winter boots. (Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash
      the bee but Vanessa saves him last second) VANESSA: Wait! : Don&apos;t
      kill him! (Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him) KEN: You know
      I&apos;m allergic to them! This thing could kill me! VANESSA: Why does his
      life have less value than yours? KEN: Why does his life have any less
      value than mine? Is that your statement? VANESSA: I&apos;m just saying all
      life has value. You don&apos;t know what he&apos;s capable of feeling.
      (Vanessa picks up Ken&apos;s brochure and puts it under the glass so she
      can carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)
      KEN: My brochure! VANESSA: There you go, little guy. (Vanessa opens the
      window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is still shocked that a
      human saved his life) KEN: I&apos;m not scared of him. It&apos;s an
      allergic thing. VANESSA: Put that on your resume brochure. KEN: My whole
      face could puff up. ANDY: Make it one of your special skills. KEN:
      Knocking someone out is also a special skill. (Ken walks to the door)
      Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. : - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
      VANESSA: - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. : (Vanessa tries to close door)
      KEN== - You could put carob chips on there. VANESSA: - Bye. (Closes door
      but Ken opens it again) KEN: - Supposed to be less calories. VANESSA: -
      Bye. (Closes door) (Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside
      the house. He flies into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)
      BARRY== (Talking to himself) I gotta say something. : She saved my life. I
      gotta say something. : All right, here it goes. (Turns back) Nah. : What
      would I say? : I could really get in trouble. : It&apos;s a bee law.
      You&apos;re not supposed to talk to a human. : I can&apos;t believe
      I&apos;m doing this. : I&apos;ve got to. (Barry disguises himself as a
      character on a food can as Vanessa walks by again) : Oh, I can&apos;t do
      it. Come on! : No. Yes. No. : Do it. I can&apos;t. : How should I start
      it? (Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows) &quot;You like
      jazz?&quot; No, that&apos;s no good. (Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)
      Here she comes! Speak, you fool! : ...Hi! (Vanessa gasps and drops the
      dishes in fright and notices Barry on the counter) : I&apos;m sorry.
      VANESSA: - You&apos;re talking. BARRY: - Yes, I know. VANESSA: (Pointing
      at Barry) You&apos;re talking! BARRY: I&apos;m so sorry. VANESSA: No,
      it&apos;s OK. It&apos;s fine. I know I&apos;m dreaming. : But I don&apos;t
      recall going to bed. BARRY: Well, I&apos;m sure this is very
      disconcerting. VANESSA: This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean,
      you&apos;re a bee! BARRY: I am. And I&apos;m not supposed to be doing
      this, (Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)
      but they were all trying to kill me. : And if it wasn&apos;t for you... :
      I had to thank you. It&apos;s just how I was raised. (Vanessa stabs her
      hand with a fork to test whether she&apos;s dreaming or not) : That was a
      little weird. VANESSA: - I&apos;m talking with a bee. BARRY: - Yeah.
      VANESSA: I&apos;m talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! BARRY: I
      just want to say I&apos;m grateful. I&apos;ll leave now. (Barry turns to
      leave) VANESSA: - Wait! How did you learn to do that? BARRY: (Flying back)
      - What? VANESSA: The talking...thing. BARRY: Same way you did, I guess.
      &quot;Mama, Dada, honey.&quot; You pick it up. VANESSA: - That&apos;s very
      funny. BARRY: - Yeah. : Bees are funny. If we didn&apos;t laugh, we&apos;d
      cry with what we have to deal with. : Anyway... VANESSA: Can I... : ...get
      you something? BARRY: - Like what? VANESSA: I don&apos;t know. I mean... I
      don&apos;t know. Coffee? BARRY: I don&apos;t want to put you out. VANESSA:
      It&apos;s no trouble. It takes two minutes. : - It&apos;s just coffee.
      BARRY: - I hate to impose. (Vanessa starts making coffee) VANESSA: -
      Don&apos;t be ridiculous! BARRY: - Actually, I would love a cup. VANESSA:
      Hey, you want rum cake? BARRY: - I shouldn&apos;t. VANESSA: - Have some.
      BARRY: - No, I can&apos;t. VANESSA: - Come on! BARRY: I&apos;m trying to
      lose a couple micrograms. VANESSA: - Where? BARRY: - These stripes
      don&apos;t help. VANESSA: You look great! BARRY: I don&apos;t know if you
      know anything about fashion. : Are you all right? VANESSA: (Pouring coffee
      on the floor and missing the cup completely) No. (Flash forward in time.
      Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table on top of the apartment
      building drinking coffee) : BARRY== He&apos;s making the tie in the cab as
      they&apos;re flying up Madison. : He finally gets there. : He runs up the
      steps into the church. The wedding is on. : And he says, &quot;Watermelon?
      I thought you said Guatemalan. : Why would I marry a watermelon?&quot;
      (Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused) VANESSA: Is that a bee joke?
      BARRY: That&apos;s the kind of stuff we do. VANESSA: Yeah, different. :
      So, what are you gonna do, Barry? (Barry stands on top of a sugar cube
      floating in his coffee and paddles it around with a straw like it&apos;s a
      gondola) BARRY: About work? I don&apos;t know. : I want to do my part for
      the hive, but I can&apos;t do it the way they want. VANESSA: I know how
      you feel. BARRY: - You do? VANESSA: - Sure. : My parents wanted me to be a
      lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. BARRY: - Really?
      VANESSA: - My only interest is flowers. BARRY: Our new queen was just
      elected with that same campaign slogan. : Anyway, if you look... (Barry
      points to a tree in the middle of Central Park) : There&apos;s my hive
      right there. See it? VANESSA: You&apos;re in Sheep Meadow! BARRY: Yes!
      I&apos;m right off the Turtle Pond! VANESSA: No way! I know that area. I
      lost a toe ring there once. BARRY: - Why do girls put rings on their toes?
      VANESSA: - Why not? BARRY: - It&apos;s like putting a hat on your knee.
      VANESSA: - Maybe I&apos;ll try that. (A custodian installing a lightbulb
      looks over at them but to his perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking
      to a cup of coffee on the table) CUSTODIAN: - You all right, ma&apos;am?
      VANESSA: - Oh, yeah. Fine. : Just having two cups of coffee! BARRY:
      Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. VANESSA== Yeah,
      it&apos;s no trouble. BARRY: Sorry I couldn&apos;t finish it. If I did,
      I&apos;d be up the rest of my life. (Barry points towards the rum cake) :
      Can I take a piece of this with me? VANESSA: Sure! Here, have a crumb.
      (Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry) BARRY:
      - Thanks! VANESSA: - Yeah. BARRY: All right. Well, then... I guess
      I&apos;ll see you around. : Or not. VANESSA: OK, Barry... BARRY: And thank
      you so much again... for before. VANESSA: Oh, that? That was nothing.
      BARRY: Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... (Vanessa and Barry hold hands,
      but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because her hands is to big and Barry
      holds that) (The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is
      laughing at her coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks
      and he falls off the ladder) (Fast forward in time and we see two Bee
      Scientists testing out a parachute in a Honex wind tunnel) BEE SCIENTIST
      #1: This can&apos;t possibly work. BEE SCIENTIST #2: He&apos;s all set to
      go. We may as well try it. : OK, Dave, pull the chute. (Dave pulls the
      chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls on his face.The
      camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking together) ADAM: -
      Sounds amazing. BARRY: - It was amazing! : It was the scariest, happiest
      moment of my life. ADAM: Humans! I can&apos;t believe you were with
      humans! : Giant, scary humans! What were they like? BARRY: Huge and crazy.
      They talk crazy. : They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. ADAM: -
      Do they try and kill you, like on TV? BARRY: - Some of them. But some of
      them don&apos;t. ADAM: - How&apos;d you get back? BARRY: - Poodle. ADAM:
      You did it, and I&apos;m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. : You
      had your &quot;experience.&quot; Now you can pick out your job and be
      normal. BARRY: - Well... ADAM: - Well? BARRY: Well, I met someone. ADAM:
      You did? Was she Bee-ish? : - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! BARRY:
      - No, no, no, not a wasp. ADAM: - Spider? BARRY: - I&apos;m not attracted
      to spiders. : I know, for everyone else, it&apos;s the hottest thing, with
      the eight legs and all. : I can&apos;t get by that face. ADAM: So who is
      she? BARRY: She&apos;s... human. ADAM: No, no. That&apos;s a bee law. You
      wouldn&apos;t break a bee law. BARRY: - Her name&apos;s Vanessa. (Adam
      puts his head in his hands) ADAM: - Oh, boy. BARRY== She&apos;s so nice.
      And she&apos;s a florist! ADAM: Oh, no! You&apos;re dating a human
      florist! BARRY: We&apos;re not dating. ADAM: You&apos;re flying outside
      the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes : with power washers and
      M-80s! That&apos;s one-eighth a stick of dynamite! BARRY: She saved my
      life! And she understands me. ADAM: This is over! BARRY: Eat this. (Barry
      gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats it)
      ADAM: (Adam&apos;s tone changes) This is not over! What was that? BARRY: -
      They call it a crumb. ADAM: - It was so stingin&apos; stripey! BARRY: And
      that&apos;s not what they eat. That&apos;s what falls off what they eat! :
      - You know what a Cinnabon is? ADAM: - No. (Adam opens a door behind him
      and he pulls Barry in) BARRY: It&apos;s bread and cinnamon and frosting.
      ADAM: Be quiet! BARRY: They heat it up... ADAM: Sit down! (Adam forces
      Barry to sit down) BARRY: (Still rambling about Cinnabons) ...really hot!
      (Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders) ADAM: - Listen to me! : We are not
      them! We&apos;re us. There&apos;s us and there&apos;s them! BARRY== Yes,
      but who can deny the heart that is yearning? ADAM: There&apos;s no
      yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! : You have got to start thinking
      bee, my friend. Thinking bee! BARRY: - Thinking bee. WORKER BEE: -
      Thinking bee. WORKER BEES AND ADAM: Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking
      bee! Thinking bee! (Flash forward in time; Barry is laying on a raft in a
      pool full of honey. He is wearing sunglasses) JANET: There he is.
      He&apos;s in the pool. MARTIN: You know what your problem is, Barry?
      (Barry pulls down his sunglasses and he looks annoyed) BARRY: (Sarcastic)
      I gotta start thinking bee? JANET: How much longer will this go on?
      MARTIN: It&apos;s been three days! Why aren&apos;t you working? (Puts
      sunglasses back on) BARRY: I&apos;ve got a lot of big life decisions to
      think about. MARTIN: What life? You have no life! You have no job.
      You&apos;re barely a bee! JANET: Would it kill you to make a little honey?
      (Barry rolls off the raft and sinks into the honey pool) : Barry, come
      out. Your father&apos;s talking to you. : Martin, would you talk to him?
      MARTIN: Barry, I&apos;m talking to you! (Barry keeps sinking into the
      honey until he is suddenly in Central Park having a picnic with Vanessa)
      (Barry has a cup of honey and he clinks his glass with Vanessas. Suddenly
      a mosquito lands on Vanessa and she slaps it, killing it. They both gasp
      but then burst out laughing) VANESSA: You coming? (The camera pans over
      and Vanessa is climbing into a small yellow airplane) BARRY: Got
      everything? VANESSA: All set! BARRY: Go ahead. I&apos;ll catch up.
      (Vanessa lifts off and flies ahead) VANESSA: Don&apos;t be too long.
      (Barry catches up with Vanessa and he sticks out his arms like ana
      irplane. He rolls from side to side, and Vanessa copies him with the
      airplane) VANESSA: Watch this! (Barry stays back and watches as Vanessa
      draws a heart in the air using pink smoke from the plane, but on the last
      loop-the-loop she suddenly crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes.
      The destroyed plane falls into some rocks and explodes a second time)
      BARRY: Vanessa! (As Barry is yelling his mouth fills with honey and he
      wakes up, discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back
      into the honey pool) MARTIN: - We&apos;re still here. JANET: - I told you
      not to yell at him. : He doesn&apos;t respond to yelling! MARTIN: - Then
      why yell at me? JANET: - Because you don&apos;t listen! MARTIN: I&apos;m
      not listening to this. BARRY: Sorry, I&apos;ve gotta go. MARTIN: - Where
      are you going? BARRY: - I&apos;m meeting a friend. JANET: A girl? Is this
      why you can&apos;t decide? BARRY: Bye. (Barry flies out the door and
      Martin shakes his head) : JANET== I just hope she&apos;s Bee-ish. (Fast
      forward in time and Barry is sitting on Vanessa&apos;s shoulder and she is
      closing up her shop) BARRY: They have a huge parade of flowers every year
      in Pasadena? VANESSA: To be in the Tournament of Roses, that&apos;s every
      florist&apos;s dream! : Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds
      cheering. BARRY: A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
      VANESSA: No. All right, I&apos;ve got one. How come you don&apos;t fly
      everywhere? BARRY: It&apos;s exhausting. Why don&apos;t you run
      everywhere? It&apos;s faster. VANESSA: Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right,
      your turn. BARRY: TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That&apos;s insane!
      VANESSA: You don&apos;t have that? BARRY: We have Hivo, but it&apos;s a
      disease. It&apos;s a horrible, horrible disease. VANESSA: Oh, my. (A human
      walks by and Barry narrowly avoids him) PASSERBY: Dumb bees! VANESSA: You
      must want to sting all those jerks. BARRY: We try not to sting. It&apos;s
      usually fatal for us. VANESSA: So you have to watch your temper (They walk
      into a store) BARRY: Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, : write
      an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: :
      Anger, jealousy, lust. (Suddenly an employee(Hector) hits Barry off of
      Vanessa&apos;s shoulder. Hector thinks he&apos;s saving Vanessa) VANESSA:
      (To Barry) Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? (Barry is getting up off the
      floor) BARRY: Yeah. VANESSA: (To Hector) - What is wrong with you?!
      HECTOR: (Confused) - It&apos;s a bug. VANESSA: He&apos;s not bothering
      anybody. Get out of here, you creep! (Vanessa hits Hector across the face
      with the magazine he had and then hits him in the head. Hector backs away
      covering his head) Barry: What was that? A Pic &apos;N&apos; Save
      circular? (Vanessa sets Barry back on her shoulder) VANESSA: Yeah, it was.
      How did you know? BARRY: It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is
      pretty much our limit. VANESSA: You&apos;ve really got that down to a
      science. BARRY: - Oh, we have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
      VANESSA: - I&apos;ll bet. (Barry looks to his right and notices there is
      honey for sale in the aisle) BARRY: What in the name of Mighty Hercules is
      this? (Barry looks at all the brands of honey, shocked) How did this get
      here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom, : Ray Liotta Private Select? (Barry puts
      his hands up and slowly turns around, a look of disgust on his face)
      VANESSA: - Is he that actor? BARRY: - I never heard of him. : - Why is
      this here? VANESSA: - For people. We eat it. BARRY: You don&apos;t have
      enough food of your own?! (Hector looks back and notices that Vanessa is
      talking to Barry) VANESSA: - Well, yes. BARRY: - How do you get it?
      VANESSA: - Bees make it. BARRY: - I know who makes it! : And it&apos;s
      hard to make it! : There&apos;s heating, cooling, stirring. You need a
      whole Krelman thing! VANESSA: - It&apos;s organic. BARRY: - It&apos;s
      our-ganic! VANESSA: It&apos;s just honey, Barry. BARRY: Just what?! : Bees
      don&apos;t know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! :
      You&apos;ve taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! :
      And it&apos;s on sale?! I&apos;m getting to the bottom of this. : I&apos;m
      getting to the bottom of all of this! (Flash forward in time; Barry paints
      his face with black strikes like a soldier and sneaks into the storage
      section of the store) (Two men, including Hector, are loading boxes into
      some trucks) : SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE== Hey, Hector. : - You almost done?
      HECTOR: - Almost. (Barry takes a step to peak around the corner)
      (Whispering) He is here. I sense it. : Well, I guess I&apos;ll go home now
      (Hector pretends to walk away by walking in place and speaking loudly) :
      and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. BARRY: You&apos;re
      busted, box boy! HECTOR: I knew I heard something! So you can talk! BARRY:
      I can talk. And now you&apos;ll start talking! : Where you getting the
      sweet stuff? Who&apos;s your supplier? HECTOR: I don&apos;t understand. I
      thought we were friends. : The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
      (Hector takes a thumbtack out of the board behind him and sword-fights
      Barry. Barry is using his stinger like a sword) : You&apos;re too late!
      It&apos;s ours now! BARRY: You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! HECTOR:
      You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! (Barry hits the thumbtack
      out of Hectors hand and Hector surrenders) Barry: Where is the honey
      coming from? : Tell me where! HECTOR: (Pointing to leaving truck) Honey
      Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! (Barry chases after the truck but it is
      getting away. He flies onto a bicyclists&apos; backpack and he catches up
      to the truck) CAR DRIVER: (To bicyclist) Crazy person! (Barry flies off
      and lands on the windshield of the Honey farms truck. Barry looks around
      and sees dead bugs splattered everywhere) BARRY: What horrible thing has
      happened here? : These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now :
      they&apos;re on the road to nowhere! (Barry hears a sudden whisper) (Barry
      looks up and sees Mooseblood, a mosquito playing dead) MOOSEBLOOD: Just
      keep still. BARRY: What? You&apos;re not dead? MOOSEBLOOD: Do I look dead?
      They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? BARRY: To Honey
      Farms. I am onto something huge here. MOOSEBLOOD: I&apos;m going to
      Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! ANOTHER BUG PLAYING
      DEAD: I&apos;m going to Tacoma. (Barry looks at another bug) BARRY: - And
      you? MOOSEBLOOD: - He really is dead. BARRY: All right. (Another bug hits
      the windshield and the drivers notice. They activate the windshield
      wipers) MOOSEBLOOD== Uh-oh! (The windshield wipers are slowly sliding over
      the dead bugs and wiping them off) BARRY: - What is that?! MOOSEBLOOD: -
      Oh, no! : - A wiper! Triple blade! BARRY: - Triple blade? MOOSEBLOOD: Jump
      on! It&apos;s your only chance, bee! (Mooseblood and Barry grab onto the
      wiper and they hold on as it wipes the windshield) Why does everything
      have to be so doggone clean?! : How much do you people need to see?!
      (Bangs on windshield) : Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!
      RADIO IN TRUCK: From NPR News in Washington, I&apos;m Carl Kasell.
      MOOSEBLOOD: But don&apos;t kill no more bugs! (Mooseblood and Barry are
      washed off by the wipr fluid) MOOSEBLOOD: - Bee! BARRY: - Moose blood
      guy!! (Barry starts screaming as he hangs onto the antenna) (Suddenly it
      is revealed that a water bug is also hanging on the antenna. There is a
      pause and then Barry and the water bug both start screaming) TRUCK DRIVER:
      - You hear something? GUY IN TRUCK: - Like what? TRUCK DRIVER: Like tiny
      screaming. GUY IN TRUCK: Turn off the radio. (The antenna starts to lower
      until it gets to low and sinks into the truck. The water bug flies off and
      Barry is forced to let go and he is blown away. He luckily lands inside a
      horn on top of the truck where he finds Mooseblood, who was blown into the
      same place) MOOSEBLOOD: Whassup, bee boy? BARRY: Hey, Blood. (Fast forward
      in time and we see that Barry is deep in conversation with Mooseblood.
      They have been sitting in this truck for a while) BARRY: ...Just a row of
      honey jars, as far as the eye could see. MOOSEBLOOD: Wow! BARRY: I assume
      wherever this truck goes is where they&apos;re getting it. : I mean, that
      honey&apos;s ours. MOOSEBLOOD: - Bees hang tight. BARRY: - We&apos;re all
      jammed in. : It&apos;s a close community. MOOSEBLOOD: Not us, man. We on
      our own. Every mosquito on his own. BARRY: - What if you get in trouble?
      MOOSEBLOOD: - You a mosquito, you in trouble. : Nobody likes us. They just
      smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! BARRY: At least you&apos;re out in
      the world. You must meet girls. MOOSEBLOOD: Mosquito girls try to trade
      up, get with a moth, dragonfly. : Mosquito girl don&apos;t want no
      mosquito. (An ambulance passes by and it has a blood donation sign on it)
      You got to be kidding me! : Mooseblood&apos;s about to leave the building!
      So long, bee! (Mooseblood leaves and flies onto the window of the
      ambulance where there are other mosquito&apos;s hanging out) : - Hey,
      guys! OTHER MOSQUITO: - Mooseblood! MOOSEBLOOD: I knew I&apos;d catch
      y&apos;all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? (The truck goes out
      of view and Barry notices that the truck he&apos;s on is pulling into a
      camp of some sort) TRUCK DRIVER: We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
      and it&apos;s pretty much pure profit. (Barry flies out) BARRY: What is
      this place? BEEKEEPER 1#: A bee&apos;s got a brain the size of a pinhead.
      BEEKEEPER #2: They are pinheads! : Pinhead. : - Check out the new smoker.
      BEEKEEPER #1: - Oh, sweet. That&apos;s the one you want. : The Thomas
      3000! BARRY: Smoker? BEEKEEPER #1: Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
      Twice the nicotine, all the tar. : A couple breaths of this knocks them
      right out. BEEKEEPER #2: They make the honey, and we make the money.
      BARRY: &quot;They make the honey, and we make the money&quot;? (The
      Beekeeper sprays hundreds of cheap miniature apartments with the smoker.
      The bees are fainting or passing out) Oh, my! : What&apos;s going on? Are
      you OK? (Barry flies into one of the apartment and helps a Bee couple get
      off the ground. They are coughing and its hard for them to stand) BEE IN
      APARTMENT: Yeah. It doesn&apos;t last too long. BARRY: Do you know
      you&apos;re in a fake hive with fake walls? BEE IN APPARTMENT: Our queen
      was moved here. We had no choice. (The apartment room is completely empty
      except for a photo on the wall of the &quot;queen&quot; who is obviously a
      man in women&apos;s clothes) BARRY: This is your queen? That&apos;s a man
      in women&apos;s clothes! : That&apos;s a drag queen! : What is this?
      (Barry flies out and he discovers that there are hundreds of these
      structures, each housing thousands of Bees) Oh, no! : There&apos;s
      hundreds of them! (Barry takes out his camera and takes pictures of these
      Bee work camps. The beekeepers look very evil in these depictions) Bee
      honey. : Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! : This is
      worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. (Flash
      forward in time and Barry is showing these pictures to his parents) JANET:
      Oh, Barry, stop. MARTIN: Who told you humans are taking our honey?
      That&apos;s a rumor. BARRY: Do these look like rumors? (Holds up the
      pictures) UNCLE CARL: That&apos;s a conspiracy theory. These are obviously
      doctored photos. JANET: How did you get mixed up in this? ADAM: He&apos;s
      been talking to humans. JANET: - What? MARTIN: - Talking to humans?! ADAM:
      He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! JANET: Make out? Barry!
      BARRY: We do not. ADAM: - You wish you could. MARTIN: - Whose side are you
      on? BARRY: The bees! UNCLE CARL: (He has been sitting in the back of the
      room this entire time) I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy
      legs kept me up all night. JANET: Barry, this is what you want to do with
      your life? BARRY: I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder
      than bees! : Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked : your hands
      were still stirring. You couldn&apos;t stop. JANET: I remember that.
      BARRY: What right do they have to our honey? : We live on two cups a year.
      They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! ADAM: Even if it&apos;s
      true, what can one bee do? BARRY: Sting them where it really hurts.
      MARTIN: In the face! The eye! : - That would hurt. BARRY: - No. MARTIN: Up
      the nose? That&apos;s a killer. BARRY: There&apos;s only one place you can
      sting the humans, one place where it matters. (Flash forward a bit in time
      and we are watching the Bee News) BEE NEWS NARRATOR: Hive at Five, the
      hive&apos;s only full-hour action news source. BEE PROTESTOR: No more bee
      beards! BEE NEWS NARRATOR: With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. : Weather
      with Storm Stinger. : Sports with Buzz Larvi. : And Jeanette Chung. BOB
      BUMBLE: - Good evening. I&apos;m Bob Bumble. JEANETTE CHUNG: - And
      I&apos;m Jeanette Chung. BOB BUMBLE: A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, :
      intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, : packaging it and
      profiting from it illegally! JEANETTE CHUNG: Tomorrow night on Bee Larry
      King, : we&apos;ll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing
      their new book, : Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. (The scene
      changes to an interview on the news with Bee version of Larry King and
      Barry) BEE LARRY KING: Tonight we&apos;re talking to Barry Benson. : Did
      you ever think, &quot;I&apos;m a kid from the hive. I can&apos;t do
      this&quot;? BARRY: Bees have never been afraid to change the world. : What
      about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? BEE LARRY KING: Where I&apos;m
      from, we&apos;d never sue humans. : We were thinking of stickball or candy
      stores. BARRY: How old are you? BEE LARRY KING: The bee community is
      supporting you in this case, : which will be the trial of the bee century.
      BARRY: You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. BEE LARRY
      KING: It&apos;s a common name. Next week... BARRY: He looks like you and
      has a show and suspenders and colored dots... BEE LARRY KING: Next week...
      BARRY: Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just
      heard &apos;em. BEE LARRY KING: Bear Week next week! They&apos;re scary,
      hairy and here, live. (Bee Larry King gets annoyed and flies away
      offscreen) BARRY: Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes,
      very Jewish. (Flash forward in time. We see Vanessa enter and Ken enters
      behind her. They are arguing) KEN: In tennis, you attack at the point of
      weakness! VANESSA: It was my grandmother, Ken. She&apos;s 81. KEN== Honey,
      her backhand&apos;s a joke! I&apos;m not gonna take advantage of that?
      BARRY: (To Ken) Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. KEN: (Pointing
      at Barry) - Is that that same bee? VANESSA: - Yes, it is! : I&apos;m
      helping him sue the human race. BARRY: - Hello. KEN: - Hello, bee.
      VANESSA: This is Ken. BARRY: (Recalling the &quot;Winter Boots&quot;
      incident earlier) Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half.
      Vibram sole, I believe. KEN: (To Vanessa) Why does he talk again? VANESSA:
      Listen, you better go &apos;cause we&apos;re really busy working. KEN: But
      it&apos;s our yogurt night! VANESSA: (Holding door open for Ken) Bye-bye.
      KEN: (Yelling) Why is yogurt night so difficult?! (Ken leaves and Vanessa
      walks over to Barry. His workplace is a mess) VANESSA: You poor thing. You
      two have been at this for hours! BARRY: Yes, and Adam here has been a huge
      help. ADAM: - Frosting... - How many sugars? ==BARRY== Just one. I try not
      to use the competition. : So why are you helping me? VANESSA: Bees have
      good qualities. : And it takes my mind off the shop. : Instead of flowers,
      people are giving balloon bouquets now. BARRY: Those are great, if
      you&apos;re three. VANESSA: And artificial flowers. BARRY: - Oh, those
      just get me psychotic! VANESSA: - Yeah, me too. : BARRY: Bent stingers,
      pointless pollination. ADAM: Bees must hate those fake things! : Nothing
      worse than a daffodil that&apos;s had work done. : Maybe this could make
      up for it a little bit. VANESSA: - This lawsuit&apos;s a pretty big deal.
      BARRY: - I guess. ADAM: You sure you want to go through with it? BARRY: Am
      I sure? When I&apos;m done with the humans, they won&apos;t be able : to
      say, &quot;Honey, I&apos;m home,&quot; without paying a royalty! (Flash
      forward in time and we are watching the human news. The camera shows a
      crowd outside a courthouse) NEWS REPORTER: It&apos;s an incredible scene
      here in downtown Manhattan, : where the world anxiously waits, because for
      the first time in history, : we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can
      actually speak. (We are no longer watching through a news camera) ADAM:
      What have we gotten into here, Barry? BARRY: It&apos;s pretty big,
      isn&apos;t it? ADAM== (Looking at the hundreds of people around the
      courthouse) I can&apos;t believe how many humans don&apos;t work during
      the day. BARRY: You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have
      good lawyers? SECURITY GUARD: Everybody needs to stay behind the
      barricade. (A limousine drives up and a fat man,Layton Montgomery, a honey
      industry owner gets out and walks past Barry) ADAM: - What&apos;s the
      matter? BARRY: - I don&apos;t know, I just got a chill. (Fast forward in
      time and everyone is in the court) MONTGOMERY: Well, if it isn&apos;t the
      bee team. (To Honey Industry lawyers) You boys work on this? MAN: All
      rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. JUDGE BUMBLETON: All right.
      Case number 4475, : Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the
      Honey Industry : is now in session. : Mr. Montgomery, you&apos;re
      representing the five food companies collectively? MONTGOMERY: A
      privilege. JUDGE BUMBLETON: Mr. Benson... you&apos;re representing all the
      bees of the world? (Everyone looks closely, they are waiting to see if a
      Bee can really talk) (Barry makes several buzzing sounds to sound like a
      Bee) BARRY: I&apos;m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we&apos;re ready to
      proceed. JUDGE BUMBLBETON: Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
      MONTGOMERY: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, : my grandmother was a
      simple woman. : Born on a farm, she believed it was man&apos;s divine
      right : to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. : If we
      lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, : just think of what
      would it mean. : I would have to negotiate with the silkworm : for the
      elastic in my britches! : Talking bee! (Montgomery walks over and looks
      closely at Barry) : How do we know this isn&apos;t some sort of :
      holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? : They could be
      using laser beams! : Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, :
      he could be on steroids! JUDGE BUMBLETON: Mr. Benson? BARRY: Ladies and
      gentlemen, there&apos;s no trickery here. : I&apos;m just an ordinary bee.
      Honey&apos;s pretty important to me. : It&apos;s important to all bees. We
      invented it! : We make it. And we protect it with our lives. :
      Unfortunately, there are some people in this room : who think they can
      take it from us : &apos;cause we&apos;re the little guys! I&apos;m hoping
      that, after this is all over, : you&apos;ll see how, by taking our honey,
      you not only take everything we have : but everything we are! JANET== (To
      Martin) I wish he&apos;d dress like that all the time. So nice! JUDGE
      BUMBLETON: Call your first witness. BARRY: So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of
      Honey Farms, big company you have. KLAUSS VANDERHAYDEN: I suppose so.
      BARRY: I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! KLAUSS: Yes, they
      provide beekeepers for our farms. BARRY: Beekeeper. I find that to be a
      very disturbing term. : I don&apos;t imagine you employ any bee-free-ers,
      do you? KLAUSS: (Quietly) - No. BARRY: - I couldn&apos;t hear you. KLAUSS:
      - No. BARRY: - No. : Because you don&apos;t free bees. You keep bees. Not
      only that, : it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for
      a jar of honey. KLAUSS: They&apos;re very lovable creatures. : Yogi Bear,
      Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. BARRY: You mean like this? (The bear from Over
      The Hedge barges in through the back door and it is roaring and standing
      on its hind legs. It is thrashing its claws and people are screaming. It
      is being held back by a guard who has the bear on a chain) : (Pointing to
      the roaring bear) Bears kill bees! : How&apos;d you like his head crashing
      through your living room?! : Biting into your couch! Spitting out your
      throw pillows! JUDGE BUMBLETON: OK, that&apos;s enough. Take him away.
      (The bear stops roaring and thrashing and walks out) BARRY: So, Mr. Sting,
      thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. : - Where have I heard
      it before? MR. STING: - I was with a band called The Police. BARRY: But
      you&apos;ve never been a police officer, have you? STING: No, I
      haven&apos;t. BARRY: No, you haven&apos;t. And so here we have yet another
      example : of bee culture casually stolen by a human : for nothing more
      than a prance-about stage name. STING: Oh, please. BARRY: Have you ever
      been stung, Mr. Sting? : Because I&apos;m feeling a little stung, Sting. :
      Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! MONTGOMERY: That&apos;s not his
      real name?! You idiots! BARRY: Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations
      on : your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. RAY LIOTTA: Thank you.
      Thank you. BARRY: I see from your resume that you&apos;re devilishly
      handsome : with a churning inner turmoil that&apos;s ready to blow. RAY
      LIOTTA: I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? BARRY: Not yet it isn&apos;t.
      But is this what it&apos;s come to for you? : Exploiting tiny, helpless
      bees so you don&apos;t : have to rehearse your part and learn your lines,
      sir? RAY LIOTTA: Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! BARRY: This
      isn&apos;t a goodfella. This is a badfella! (Ray Liotta looses it and
      tries to grab Barry) RAY LIOTTA: Why doesn&apos;t someone just step on
      this creep, and we can all go home?! JUDGE BUMBLETON: - Order in this
      court! RAY LIOTTA: - You&apos;re all thinking it! (Judge Bumbleton starts
      banging her gavel) JUDGE BUMBLETON: Order! Order, I say! RAY LIOTTA: - Say
      it! MAN: - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! (We see a montage of magazines
      which feature the court case) (Flash forward in time and Barry is back
      home with Vanessa) BARRY: I think it was awfully nice of that bear to
      pitch in like that. VANESSA: I think the jury&apos;s on our side. BARRY:
      Are we doing everything right,you know, legally? VANESSA: I&apos;m a
      florist. BARRY: Right. Well, here&apos;s to a great team. VANESSA: To a
      great team! (Ken walks in from work. He sees Barry and he looks upset when
      he sees Barry clinking his glass with Vanessa) KEN: Well, hello. VANESSA:
      - Oh, Ken! BARRY: - Hello! VANESSA: I didn&apos;t think you were coming. :
      No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... (Ken holds up his phone and
      flips it open. The phone has no charge) ...the battery... VANESSA: I
      didn&apos;t want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he
      was free. KEN: Oh, that was lucky. (Ken sits down at the table across from
      Barry and Vanessa leaves the room) VANESSA: There&apos;s a little left. I
      could heat it up. KEN: (Not taking his eyes off Barry) Yeah, heat it up,
      sure, whatever. BARRY: So I hear you&apos;re quite a tennis player. :
      I&apos;m not much for the game myself. The ball&apos;s a little grabby.
      KEN: That&apos;s where I usually sit. Right... (Points to where Barry is
      sitting) there. VANESSA: (Calling from other room) Ken, Barry was looking
      at your resume, : and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks
      isn&apos;t really a special skill. KEN: (To Barry) You think I don&apos;t
      see what you&apos;re doing? BARRY: I know how hard it is to find the right
      job. We have that in common. KEN: Do we? BARRY: Bees have 100 percent
      employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. KEN: (Menacingly)
      That&apos;s just what I was thinking about doing. (Ken reaches for a fork
      on the table but knocks if on the floor. He goes to pick it up) VANESSA:
      Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all
      right. (Ken quickly rises back up after hearing this but hits his head on
      the table and yells) BARRY: I&apos;m going to drain the old stinger. KEN:
      Yeah, you do that. (Barry flies past Ken to get to the bathroom and Ken
      freaks out, splashing some of the wine he was using to cool his head in
      his eyes. He yells in anger) (Barry looks at the magazines featuring his
      victories in court) BARRY: Look at that. (Barry flies into the bathroom)
      (He puts his hand on his head but this makes hurts him and makes him even
      madder. He yells again) (Barry is washing his hands in the sink but then
      Ken walks in) KEN: You know, you know I&apos;ve just about had it (Closes
      bathroom door behind him) with your little mind games. (Ken is menacingly
      rolling up a magazine) BARRY: (Backing away) - What&apos;s that? KEN: -
      Italian Vogue. BARRY: Mamma mia, that&apos;s a lot of pages. KEN:
      It&apos;s a lot of ads. BARRY: Remember what Van said, why is your life
      more valuable than mine? KEN: That&apos;s funny, I just can&apos;t seem to
      recall that! (Ken smashes everything off the sink with the magazine and
      Barry narrowly escapes) (Ken follows Barry around and tries to hit him
      with the magazine but he keeps missing) (Ken gets a spray bottle) : I
      think something stinks in here! BARRY: (Enjoying the spray) I love the
      smell of flowers. (Ken holds a lighter in front of the spray bottle) KEN:
      How do you like the smell of flames?! BARRY: Not as much. (Ken fires his
      make-shift flamethrower but misses Barry, burning the bathroom. He torches
      the whole room but looses his footing and falls into the bathtub. After
      getting hit in the head by falling objects 3 times he picks up the shower
      head, revealing a Water bug hiding under it) WATER BUG: Water bug! Not
      taking sides! (Barry gets up out of a pile of bathroom supplies and he is
      wearing a chapstick hat) BARRY: Ken, I&apos;m wearing a Chapstick hat!
      This is pathetic! (Ken switches the shower head to lethal) KEN: I&apos;ve
      got issues! (Ken sprays Barry with the shower head and he crash lands into
      the toilet) (Ken menacingly looks down into the toilet at Barry) Well,
      well, well, a royal flush! BARRY: - You&apos;re bluffing. KEN: - Am I?
      (flushes toilet) (Barry grabs a chapstick from the toilet seat and uses it
      to surf in the flushing toilet) BARRY: Surf&apos;s up, dude! (Barry flies
      out of the toilet on the chapstick and sprays Ken&apos;s face with the
      toilet water) : EW,Poo water! BARRY: That bowl is gnarly. KEN: (Aiming a
      toilet cleaner at Barry) Except for those dirty yellow rings! (Barry
      cowers and covers his head and Vanessa runs in and takes the toilet
      cleaner from Ken just before he hits Barry) VANESSA: Kenneth! What are you
      doing?! KEN== (Leaning towards Barry) You know, I don&apos;t even like
      honey! I don&apos;t eat it! VANESSA: We need to talk! (Vanessa pulls Ken
      out of the bathroom) : He&apos;s just a little bee! : And he happens to be
      the nicest bee I&apos;ve met in a long time! KEN: Long time? What are you
      talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? VANESSA: No, but there
      are other things bugging me in life. And you&apos;re one of them! KEN:
      Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... : My nerves are fried from riding
      on this emotional roller coaster! VANESSA: Goodbye, Ken. (Ken huffs and
      walks out and slams the door. But suddenly he walks back in and stares at
      Barry) : And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial
      sweeteners MADE BY MAN! (Ken leaves again and Vanessa leans in towards
      Barry) VANESSA: I&apos;m sorry about all that. (Ken walks back in again)
      KEN: I know it&apos;s got an aftertaste! I LIKE IT! (Ken leaves for the
      last time) VANESSA: I always felt there was some kind of barrier between
      Ken and me. : I couldn&apos;t overcome it. Oh, well. : Are you OK for the
      trial? BARRY: I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. (Flash
      forward in time and Barry, Adam, and Vanessa are back in court)
      MONTGOMERY-- We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
      ADAM: Good idea! You can really see why he&apos;s considered one of the
      best lawyers... (Barry stares at Adam) ...Yeah. LAWYER: Layton,
      you&apos;ve gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it&apos;s gonna be
      all over. MONTGOMERY: Don&apos;t worry. The only thing I have to do to
      turn this jury around : is to remind them of what they don&apos;t like
      about bees. (To lawyer) - You got the tweezers? LAWYER: - Are you
      allergic? MONTGOMERY: Only to losing, son. Only to losing. : Mr. Benson
      Bee, I&apos;ll ask you what I think we&apos;d all like to know. : What
      exactly is your relationship (Points to Vanessa) : to that woman? BARRY:
      We&apos;re friends. MONTGOMERY: - Good friends? BARRY: - Yes. MONTGOMERY:
      How good? Do you live together? ADAM: Wait a minute... : MONTGOMERY: Are
      you her little... : ...bedbug? (Adam&apos;s stinger starts vibrating. He
      is agitated) I&apos;ve seen a bee documentary or two. From what I
      understand, : doesn&apos;t your queen give birth to all the bee children?
      BARRY: - Yeah, but... MONTGOMERY: (Pointing at Janet and Martin) - So
      those aren&apos;t your real parents! JANET: - Oh, Barry... BARRY: - Yes,
      they are! ADAM: Hold me back! (Vanessa tries to hold Adam back. He wants
      to sting Montgomery) MONTGOMERY: You&apos;re an illegitimate bee,
      aren&apos;t you, Benson? ADAM: He&apos;s denouncing bees! MONTGOMERY:
      Don&apos;t y&apos;all date your cousins? (Montgomery leans over on the
      jury stand and stares at Adam) VANESSA: - Objection! (Vanessa raises her
      hand to object but Adam gets free. He flies straight at Montgomery) =ADAM:
      - I&apos;m going to pincushion this guy! BARRY: Adam, don&apos;t!
      It&apos;s what he wants! (Adam stings Montgomery in the butt and he starts
      thrashing around) MONTGOMERY: Oh, I&apos;m hit!! : Oh, lordy, I am hit!
      JUDGE BUMBLETON: (Banging gavel) Order! Order! MONTGOMERY: (Overreacting)
      The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! : I have been felled by
      a winged beast of destruction! : You see? You can&apos;t treat them like
      equals! They&apos;re striped savages! : Stinging&apos;s the only thing
      they know! It&apos;s their way! BARRY: - Adam, stay with me. ADAM: - I
      can&apos;t feel my legs. MONTGOMERY: (Overreacting and throwing his body
      around the room) What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison
      : from my heaving buttocks? JUDGE BUMLBETON: I will have order in this
      court. Order! : Order, please! (Flash forward in time and we see a human
      news reporter) NEWS REPORTER: The case of the honeybees versus the human
      race : took a pointed turn against the bees : yesterday when one of their
      legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. (Adam is laying in a hospital bed
      and Barry flies in to see him) BARRY: - Hey, buddy. ADAM: - Hey. BARRY: -
      Is there much pain? ADAM: - Yeah. : I... : I blew the whole case,
      didn&apos;t I? BARRY: It doesn&apos;t matter. What matters is you&apos;re
      alive. You could have died. ADAM: I&apos;d be better off dead. Look at me.
      (A small plastic sword is replaced as Adam&apos;s stinger) They got it
      from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. : Look, there&apos;s a
      little celery still on it. (Flicks off the celery and sighs) BARRY: What
      was it like to sting someone? ADAM: I can&apos;t explain it. It was all...
      : All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! BARRY: ...All right. ADAM:
      You think it was all a trap? BARRY: Of course. I&apos;m sorry. I flew us
      right into this. : What were we thinking? Look at us. We&apos;re just a
      couple of bugs in this world. ADAM: What will the humans do to us if they
      win? BARRY: I don&apos;t know. ADAM: I hear they put the roaches in
      motels. That doesn&apos;t sound so bad. BARRY: Adam, they check in, but
      they don&apos;t check out! ADAM: Oh, my. (Coughs) Could you get a nurse to
      close that window? BARRY: - Why? ADAM: - The smoke. (We can see that two
      humans are smoking cigarettes outside) : Bees don&apos;t smoke. BARRY:
      Right. Bees don&apos;t smoke. : Bees don&apos;t smoke! But some bees are
      smoking. : That&apos;s it! That&apos;s our case! ADAM: It is? It&apos;s
      not over? BARRY: Get dressed. I&apos;ve gotta go somewhere. : Get back to
      the court and stall. Stall any way you can. (Flash forward in time and
      Adam is making a paper boat in the courtroom) ADAM: And assuming
      you&apos;ve done step 29 correctly, you&apos;re ready for the tub! (We see
      that the jury have each made their own paper boats after being taught how
      by Adam. They all look confused) JUDGE BUMBLETON: Mr. Flayman. ADAM: Yes?
      Yes, Your Honor! JUDGE BUMBLETON: Where is the rest of your team? ADAM:
      (Continues stalling) Well, Your Honor, it&apos;s interesting. : Bees are
      trained to fly haphazardly, : and as a result, we don&apos;t make very
      good time. : I actually heard a funny story about... MONTGOMERY: Your
      Honor, haven&apos;t these ridiculous bugs : taken up enough of this
      court&apos;s valuable time? : How much longer will we allow these absurd
      shenanigans to go on? : They have presented no compelling evidence to
      support their charges : against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.
      : I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! JUDGE BUMBLETON:
      Mr. Flayman, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going : to have to consider Mr.
      Montgomery&apos;s motion. ADAM: But you can&apos;t! We have a terrific
      case. MONTGOMERY: Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? : Show me
      the smoking gun! BARRY: (Barry flies in through the door) Hold it, Your
      Honor! You want a smoking gun? : Here is your smoking gun. (Vanessa walks
      in holding a bee smoker. She sets it down on the Judge&apos;s podium)
      JUDGE BUMBLETON: What is that? BARRY: It&apos;s a bee smoker! MONTGOMERY:
      (Picks up smoker) What, this? This harmless little contraption? : This
      couldn&apos;t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. (Montgomery accidentally fires
      it at the bees in the crowd and they faint and cough) (Dozens of reporters
      start taking pictures of the suffering bees) BARRY: Look at what has
      happened : to bees who have never been asked, &quot;Smoking or non?&quot;
      : Is this what nature intended for us? : To be forcibly addicted to smoke
      machines : and man-made wooden slat work camps? : Living out our lives as
      honey slaves to the white man? (Barry points to the honey industry owners.
      One of them is an African American so he awkwardly separates himself from
      the others) LAWYER: - What are we gonna do? - He&apos;s playing the
      species card. BARRY: Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! ADAM
      AND VANESSA: Free the bees! Free the bees! BEES IN CROWD: Free the bees!
      HUMAN JURY: Free the bees! Free the bees! JUDGE BUMBLETON: The court finds
      in favor of the bees! BARRY: Vanessa, we won! VANESSA: I knew you could do
      it! High-five! (Vanessa hits Barry hard because her hand is too big) :
      Sorry. BARRY: (Overjoyed) I&apos;m OK! You know what this means? : All the
      honey will finally belong to the bees. : Now we won&apos;t have to work so
      hard all the time. MONTGOMERY: This is an unholy perversion of the balance
      of nature, Benson. : You&apos;ll regret this. (Montgomery leaves and Barry
      goes outside the courtroom. Several reporters start asking Barry
      questions) REPORTER 1#: Barry, how much honey is out there? BARRY: All
      right. One at a time. REPORTER 2#: Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY: My
      sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. (Barry flies outside with
      the paparazzi and Adam and Vanessa stay back) ADAM: (To Vanessa) - What if
      Montgomery&apos;s right? Vanessa: - What do you mean? ADAM: We&apos;ve
      been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. (Flash forward in
      time and Barry is talking to a man) BUSINESS MAN: Congratulations on your
      victory. What will you demand as a settlement? BARRY: First, we&apos;ll
      demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. (As Barry is talking we
      see a montage of men putting &quot;closed&quot; tape over the work camps
      and freeing the bees in the crappy apartments) Then we want back the honey
      that was ours to begin with, : every last drop. (Men in suits are pushing
      all the honey of the aisle and into carts) We demand an end to the
      glorification of the bear as anything more (We see a statue of a
      bear-shaped honey container being pulled down by bees) than a filthy,
      smelly, bad-breath stink machine. : We&apos;re all aware of what they do
      in the woods. (We see Winnie the Pooh sharing his honey with Piglet in the
      cross-hairs of a high-tech sniper rifle) BARRY: (Looking through
      binoculars) Wait for my signal. : Take him out. (Winnie gets hit by a
      tranquilizer dart and dramatically falls off the log he was standing on,
      his tongue hanging out. Piglet looks at Pooh in fear and the Sniper takes
      the honey.) SNIPER: He&apos;ll have nausea for a few hours, then
      he&apos;ll be fine. (Flash forward in time) BARRY: And we will no longer
      tolerate bee-negative nicknames... (Mr. Sting is sitting at home until he
      is taken out of his house by the men in suits) STING: But it&apos;s just a
      prance-about stage name! BARRY: ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus
      health products : and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. (An old
      lady is mixing honey into her tea but suddenly men in suits smash her face
      down on the table and take the honey) OLD LADY: Can&apos;t breathe. (A
      honey truck pulls up to Barry&apos;s hive) WORKER: Bring it in, boys! :
      Hold it right there! Good. : Tap it. (Tons of honey is being pumped into
      the hive&apos;s storage) BEE WORKER 1#: (Honey overflows from the cup) Mr.
      Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there&apos;s gallons more coming!
      : - I think we need to shut down! =BEE WORKER #2= - Shut down? We&apos;ve
      never shut down. : Shut down honey production! DEAN BUZZWELL: Stop making
      honey! (The bees all leave their stations. Two bees run into a room and
      they put the keys into a machine) Turn your key, sir! (Two worker bees
      dramatically turn their keys, which opens the button which they press,
      shutting down the honey-making machines. This is the first time this has
      ever happened) BEE: ...What do we do now? (Flash forward in time and a Bee
      is about to jump into a pool full of honey) Cannonball! (The bee gets
      stuck in the honey and we get a short montage of Bees leaving work) (We
      see the Pollen Jocks flying but one of them gets a call on his antenna)
      LOU LU DUVA: (Through &quot;phone&quot;) We&apos;re shutting honey
      production! : Mission abort. POLLEN JOCK #1: Aborting pollination and
      nectar detail. Returning to base. (The Pollen Jocks fly back to the hive)
      (We get a time lapse of Central Park slowly wilting away as the bees all
      relax) BARRY: Adam, you wouldn&apos;t believe how much honey was out
      there. ADAM: Oh, yeah? BARRY: What&apos;s going on? Where is everybody?
      (The entire street is deserted) : - Are they out celebrating? ADAM: -
      They&apos;re home. : They don&apos;t know what to do. Laying out, sleeping
      in. : I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a
      cricket. BARRY: At least we got our honey back. ADAM: Sometimes I think,
      so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn&apos;t? : It&apos;s the
      greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. : This
      was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. : And
      now... : Now I can&apos;t. (Flash forward in time and Barry is talking to
      Vanessa) BARRY: I don&apos;t understand why they&apos;re not happy. : I
      thought their lives would be better! : They&apos;re doing nothing.
      It&apos;s amazing. Honey really changes people. VANESSA: You don&apos;t
      have any idea what&apos;s going on, do you? BARRY: - What did you want to
      show me? (Vanessa takes Barry to the rooftop where they first had coffee
      and points to her store) VANESSA: - This. (Points at her flowers. They are
      all grey and wilting) BARRY: What happened here? VANESSA: That is not the
      half of it. (Small flash forward in time and Vanessa and Barry are on the
      roof of her store and she points to Central Park) (We see that Central
      Park is no longer green and colorful, rather it is grey, brown, and
      dead-like. It is very depressing to look at) BARRY: Oh, no. Oh, my. :
      They&apos;re all wilting. VANESSA: Doesn&apos;t look very good, does it?
      BARRY: No. VANESSA: And whose fault do you think that is? BARRY: You know,
      I&apos;m gonna guess bees. VANESSA== (Staring at Barry) Bees? BARRY:
      Specifically, me. : I didn&apos;t think bees not needing to make honey
      would affect all these things. VANESSA: It&apos;s not just flowers.
      Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. BARRY: That&apos;s our whole SAT
      test right there. VANESSA: Take away produce, that affects the entire
      animal kingdom. : And then, of course... BARRY: The human species? : So if
      there&apos;s no more pollination, : it could all just go south here,
      couldn&apos;t it? VANESSA: I know this is also partly my fault. BARRY: How
      about a suicide pact? VANESSA: How do we do it? BARRY: - I&apos;ll sting
      you, you step on me. VANESSA: - That just kills you twice. BARRY: Right,
      right. VANESSA: Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. (Vanessa
      leaves) BARRY: (To himself) I had to open my mouth and talk. : Vanessa? :
      Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? (Vanessa is getting
      into a taxi) VANESSA: To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.
      : They&apos;ve moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
      : It&apos;s the last chance I&apos;ll ever have to see it. BARRY: Vanessa,
      I just wanna say I&apos;m sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.
      VANESSA: I know. Me neither. (The taxi starts to drive away) BARRY:
      Tournament of Roses. Roses can&apos;t do sports. : Wait a minute. Roses.
      Roses? : Roses! : Vanessa! (Barry flies after the Taxi) VANESSA: Roses?! :
      Barry? (Barry is flying outside the window of the taxi) BARRY: - Roses are
      flowers! VANESSA: - Yes, they are. BARRY: Flowers, bees, pollen! VANESSA:
      I know. That&apos;s why this is the last parade. BARRY: Maybe not. Could
      you ask him to slow down? VANESSA: Could you slow down? (The taxi driver
      screeches to a stop and Barry keeps flying forward) : Barry! (Barry flies
      back to the window) BARRY: OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total
      disaster, all my fault. VANESSA: Yes, it kind of is. BARRY: I&apos;ve
      ruined the planet. I wanted to help you : with the flower shop. I&apos;ve
      made it worse. VANESSA: Actually, it&apos;s completely closed down. BARRY:
      I thought maybe you were remodeling. : But I have another idea, and
      it&apos;s greater than my previous ideas combined. VANESSA: I don&apos;t
      want to hear it! BARRY: All right, they have the roses, the roses have the
      pollen. : I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. : All we
      gotta do is get what they&apos;ve got back here with what we&apos;ve got.
      : - Bees. VANESSA: - Park. BARRY: - Pollen! VANESSA: - Flowers. BARRY: -
      Re-pollination! VANESSA: - Across the nation! : Tournament of Roses,
      Pasadena, California. : They&apos;ve got nothing but flowers, floats and
      cotton candy. : Security will be tight. BARRY: I have an idea. (Flash
      forward in time. Vanessa is about to board a plane which has all the Roses
      on board. VANESSA: Vanessa Bloome, FTD. (Holds out badge) : Official
      floral business. It&apos;s real. SECURITY GUARD: Sorry, ma&apos;am. Nice
      brooch. =VANESSA== Thank you. It was a gift. (Barry is revealed to be
      hiding inside the brooch) (Flash back in time and Barry and Vanessa are
      discussing their plan) BARRY: Once inside, we just pick the right float.
      VANESSA: How about The Princess and the Pea? : I could be the princess,
      and you could be the pea! BARRY: Yes, I got it. : - Where should I sit?
      GUARD: - What are you? BARRY: - I believe I&apos;m the pea. GUARD: - The
      pea? VANESSA: It goes under the mattresses. GUARD: - Not in this fairy
      tale, sweetheart. - I&apos;m getting the marshal. VANESSA: You do that!
      This whole parade is a fiasco! : Let&apos;s see what this baby&apos;ll do.
      (Vanessa drives the float through traffic) GUARD: Hey, what are you
      doing?! BARRY== Then all we do is blend in with traffic... : ...without
      arousing suspicion. : Once at the airport, there&apos;s no stopping us.
      (Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are about to get on a plane)
      SECURITY GUARD: Stop! Security. : - You and your insect pack your float?
      VANESSA: - Yes. SECURITY GUARD: Has it been in your possession the entire
      time? VANESSA: - Yes. SECURITY GUARD: Would you remove your shoes? (To
      Barry) - Remove your stinger. BARRY: - It&apos;s part of me. SECURITY
      GUARD: I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. (Barry plotting
      with Vanessa) BARRY: Then if we&apos;re lucky, we&apos;ll have just enough
      pollen to do the job. (Flash forward in time and Barry and Vanessa are
      flying on the plane) Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough
      pollen to do the job! VANESSA: I think this is gonna work. BARRY:
      It&apos;s got to work. CAPTAIN SCOTT: (On intercom) Attention, passengers,
      this is Captain Scott. : We have a bit of bad weather in New York. : It
      looks like we&apos;ll experience a couple hours delay. VANESSA: Barry,
      these are cut flowers with no water. They&apos;ll never make it. BARRY: I
      gotta get up there and talk to them. VANESSA== Be careful. (Barry flies
      right outside the cockpit door) BARRY: Can I get help with the Sky Mall
      magazine? I&apos;d like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair
      trimmer. (The flight attendant opens the door and walks out and Barry
      flies into the cockpit unseen) BARRY: Captain, I&apos;m in a real
      situation. CAPTAIN SCOTT: - What&apos;d you say, Hal? CO-PILOT HAL: -
      Nothing. (Scott notices Barry and freaks out) CAPTAIN SCOTT: Bee! BARRY:
      No,no,no, Don&apos;t freak out! My entire species... (Captain Scott gets
      out of his seat and tries to suck Barry into a handheld vacuum) HAL: (To
      Scott) What are you doing? (Barry lands on Hals hair but Scott sees him.
      He tries to suck up Barry but instead he sucks up Hals toupee) CAPTAIN
      SCOTT: Uh-oh. BARRY: - Wait a minute! I&apos;m an attorney! HAL: (Hal
      doesn&apos;t know Barry is on his head) - Who&apos;s an attorney? CAPTAIN
      SCOTT: Don&apos;t move. (Scott hits Hal in the face with the vacuum in an
      attempt to hit Barry. Hal is knocked out and he falls on the life raft
      button which launches an infalatable boat into Scott, who gets knocked out
      and falls to the floor. They are both uncounscious.) BARRY: (To himself)
      Oh, Barry. BARRY: (On intercom, with a Southern accent) Good afternoon,
      passengers. This is your captain. : Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
      please report to the cockpit? (Vanessa looks confused) (Normal accent)
      ...And please hurry! (Vanessa opens the door and sees the life raft and
      the uncounscious pilots) VANESSA: What happened here? BARRY: I tried to
      talk to them, but then there was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft
      exploded. : Now one&apos;s bald, one&apos;s in a boat, and they&apos;re
      both unconscious! VANESSA: ...Is that another bee joke? BARRY: - No! : No
      one&apos;s flying the plane! BUD DITCHWATER: (Through radio on plane) This
      is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What&apos;s your status? VANESSA: This
      is Vanessa Bloome. I&apos;m a florist from New York. BUD: Where&apos;s the
      pilot? VANESSA: He&apos;s unconscious, and so is the copilot. BUD: Not
      good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? BARRY: As a matter of
      fact, there is. BUD: - Who&apos;s that? BARRY: - Barry Benson. BUD: From
      the honey trial?! Oh, great. BARRY: Vanessa, this is nothing more than a
      big metal bee. : It&apos;s got giant wings, huge engines. VANESSA: I
      can&apos;t fly a plane. BARRY: - Why not? Isn&apos;t John Travolta a
      pilot? VANESSA: - Yes. BARRY: How hard could it be? (Vanessa sits down and
      flies for a little bit but we see lightning clouds outside the window)
      VANESSA: Wait, Barry! We&apos;re headed into some lightning. (An ominous
      lightning storm looms in front of the plane) (We are now watching the Bee
      News) BOB BUMBLE: This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from
      JFK Airport, : where a suspenseful scene is developing. : Barry Benson,
      fresh from his legal victory... ADAM: That&apos;s Barry! BOB BUMBLE: ...is
      attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers : and an
      incapacitated flight crew. JANET, MARTIN, UNCLE CAR AND ADAM: Flowers?!
      (The scene switches to the human news) REPORTER: (Talking with Bob Bumble)
      We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls : with
      absolutely no flight experience. BOB BUMBLE: Just a minute. There&apos;s a
      bee on that plane. BUD: I&apos;m quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his
      no-account compadres. : They&apos;ve done enough damage. REPORTER: But
      isn&apos;t he your only hope? BUD: Technically, a bee shouldn&apos;t be
      able to fly at all. : Their wings are too small... BARRY: (Through radio)
      Haven&apos;t we heard this a million times? : &quot;The surface area of
      the wings and body mass make no sense.&quot;... BOB BUMBLE: - Get this on
      the air! BEE: - Got it. BEE NEWS CREW: - Stand by. BEE NEWS CREW: -
      We&apos;re going live! BARRY: (Through radio on TV) ...The way we work may
      be a mystery to you. : Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of
      small jobs. : But let me tell you about a small job. : If you do it well,
      it makes a big difference. : More than we realized. To us, to everyone. :
      That&apos;s why I want to get bees back to working together. : That&apos;s
      the bee way! We&apos;re not made of Jell-O. : We get behind a fellow. : -
      Black and yellow! BEES: - Hello! (The scene switches and Barry is teaching
      Vanessa how to fly) BARRY: Left, right, down, hover. VANESSA: - Hover?
      BARRY: - Forget hover. VANESSA: This isn&apos;t so hard. (Pretending to
      honk the horn) Beep-beep! Beep-beep! (A Lightning bolt hits the plane and
      autopilot turns off) Barry, what happened?! BARRY: Wait, I think we were
      on autopilot the whole time. VANESSA: - That may have been helping me.
      BARRY: - And now we&apos;re not! VANESSA: So it turns out I cannot fly a
      plane. (The plane plummets but we see Lou Lu Duva and the Pollen Jocks,
      along with multiple other bees flying towards the plane) Lou Lu DUva: All
      of you, let&apos;s get behind this fellow! Move it out! : Move out! (The
      scene switches back to Vanessa and Barry in the plane) BARRY: Our only
      chance is if I do what I&apos;d do, you copy me with the wings of the
      plane! (Barry sticks out his arms like an airplane and flys in front of
      Vanessa&apos;s face) VANESSA: Don&apos;t have to yell. BARRY: I&apos;m not
      yelling! We&apos;re in a lot of trouble. VANESSA: It&apos;s very hard to
      concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! BARRY: It&apos;s not a
      tone. I&apos;m panicking! VANESSA: I can&apos;t do this! (Barry slaps
      Vanessa) BARRY: Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of
      it! VANESSA: (Slaps Barry) You snap out of it. BARRY: (Slaps Vanessa) :
      You snap out of it. VANESSA: - You snap out of it! BARRY: - You snap out
      of it! (We see that all the Pollen Jocks are flying under the plane)
      VANESSA: - You snap out of it! BARRY: - You snap out of it! VANESSA: - You
      snap out of it! BARRY: - You snap out of it! VANESSA: - Hold it! BARRY: -
      Why? Come on, it&apos;s my turn. VANESSA: How is the plane flying? (The
      plane is now safely flying) VANESSA: I don&apos;t know. (Barry&apos;s
      antennae rings like a phone. Barry picks up) BARRY: Hello? LOU LU DUVA:
      (Through &quot;phone&quot;) Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion
      in there? (All of the Pollen Jocks are carrying the plane) BARRY: The
      Pollen Jocks! : They do get behind a fellow. LOU LU DUVA: - Black and
      yellow. POLLEN JOCKS: - Hello. LOU LU DUVA: All right, let&apos;s drop
      this tin can on the blacktop. BARRY: Where? I can&apos;t see anything. Can
      you? VANESSA: No, nothing. It&apos;s all cloudy. : Come on. You got to
      think bee, Barry. BARRY: - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. (On the runway
      there are millions of bees laying on their backs) BEES: Thinking bee!
      Thinking bee! Thinking bee! BARRY: Wait a minute. I think I&apos;m feeling
      something. VANESSA: - What? BARRY: - I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s strong,
      pulling me. : Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. : Bring the nose down.
      BEES: Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! CONTROL TOWER OPERATOR: -
      What in the world is on the tarmac? BUD: - Get some lights on that! (It is
      revealed that all the bees are organized into a giant pulsating flower
      formation) BEES: Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! BARRY: -
      Vanessa, aim for the flower. VANESSA: - OK. BARRY: Out the engines.
      We&apos;re going in on bee power. Ready, boys? LOU LU DUVA: Affirmative!
      BARRY: Good. Good. Easy, now. That&apos;s it. : Land on that flower! :
      Ready? Full reverse! : Spin it around! (The plane&apos;s nose is pointed
      at a flower painted on a nearby plane) - Not that flower! The other one!
      VANESSA: - Which one? BARRY: - That flower. (The plane is now pointed at a
      fat guy in a flowered shirt. He freaks out and tries to take a picture of
      the plane) VANESSA: - I&apos;m aiming at the flower! BARRY: That&apos;s a
      fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of
      millions of bees! (The plane hovers over the bee-flower) : Pull forward.
      Nose down. Tail up. : Rotate around it. VANESSA: - This is insane, Barry!
      BARRY: - This&apos;s the only way I know how to fly. BUD: Am I
      koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? (The
      plane is unrealistically hovering and spinning over the bee-flower) BARRY:
      Get your nose in there. Don&apos;t be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! :
      Just drop it. Be a part of it. : Aim for the center! : Now drop it in!
      Drop it in, woman! : Come on, already. (The bees scatter and the plane
      safely lands) VANESSA: Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! BARRY:
      - Yes! (Vanessa is about to high-five Barry) No high-five! VANESSA: -
      Right. ADAM: Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? BARRY: What
      giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! ADAM: -
      Thank you. BARRY: - But we&apos;re not done yet. : Listen, everyone! :
      This runway is covered with the last pollen : from the last flowers
      available anywhere on Earth. : That means this is our last chance. :
      We&apos;re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like
      this. : If we&apos;re gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What
      do you say? : Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History
      keychains? BEES: We&apos;re bees! BEE WHO LIKES KEYCHAINS: Keychain!
      BARRY: Then follow me! Except Keychain. POLLEN JOCK #1: Hold on, Barry.
      Here. : You&apos;ve earned this. BARRY: Yeah! : I&apos;m a Pollen Jock!
      And it&apos;s a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. (The Pollen
      Jocks throw Barry a nectar-collecting gun. Barry catches it) Oh, yeah.
      JANET: That&apos;s our Barry. (Barry and the Pollen Jocks get pollen from
      the flowers on the plane) (Flash forward in time and the Pollen Jocks are
      flying over NYC) : (Barry pollinates the flowers in Vanessa&apos;s shop
      and then heads to Central Park) BOY IN PARK: Mom! The bees are back! ADAM:
      (Putting on his Krelman hat) If anybody needs to make a call, now&apos;s
      the time. : I got a feeling we&apos;ll be working late tonight! (The bee
      honey factories are back up and running) (Meanwhile at Vanessa&apos;s
      shop) VANESSA: (To customer) Here&apos;s your change. Have a great
      afternoon! Can I help who&apos;s next? : Would you like some honey with
      that? It is bee-approved. Don&apos;t forget these. (There is a room in the
      shop where Barry does legal work for other animals. He is currently
      talking with a Cow) COW: Milk, cream, cheese, it&apos;s all me. And I
